## Apartment Model

### Overview

The `Apartment` class represents an apartment entity with its associated properties and behaviors.

### Class Definition: `Apartment`

#### Properties

* `int id`: A unique identifier for the apartment.
* `String address`: The physical address of the apartment.

* `bool isFurnished`: Indicates whether the apartment is furnished (`true`) or not (`false`).
* `bool isRented`: Indicates whether the apartment is currently rented. Defaults to `false` if not specified.

#### Constructor

```dart
Apartment({
  required this.id,
  required this.address,
  required this.rentPrice,
  required this.floorNumber,
  required this.isFurnished,
  this.isRented = false,
});
```

#### Method: `displayInfo()`

Prints the details of the apartment in a readable format.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
Apartment myApartment = Apartment(
  id: 1,
  address: "123 Main St",
  rentPrice: 1200.50,
  floorNumber: 3,
  isFurnished: true,
);

}
```

**Example Usage:**

```dart
void main() {
  House myHouse = House(id: 1, address: "123 Sunny St", rentPrice: 1500.00);
